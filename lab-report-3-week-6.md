Something that is common when you log in is you havew to type your whole ssh Username when trying to get into the server. You don't have to do that now! All you have to do is 
follow these steps.

1. First you want to go on to the terminal go back into your directory untill you get to users directory.then you want to type ``` cd .ssh```.![image](/images/Screenshot344.png)
